JS 

scope

JS is dynamic 

TS is compiled version of JS

let age = 42;
let age = 'john';

const age = 42;
var = global scope <-- NOT SAFE!!! because it is global, use let or const instead.

<script></script> <-- these tags con"nect the script to the html

connect to DOM nodes in html and bring those nodes into JS code, for this...use and API (API acts as a bridge)
API: document(DOM) <-- accesses DOM structure

let object = document.getElementByClassName("description");

EVENTS: click, db click, onChange (for text fields)
